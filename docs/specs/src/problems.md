Possible issues
===

* A host may ask a user with whom he wants to share a room. Do we use
  a simple text field in which the user can enter a name (possible typing errors)
  or do we provide a list (what if that user is not already registered - privacy
  issues with names of people of other countries).

* Can a user change country within the system? A UI for this is not needed,
  but changing this in the database might lead to problems. To investigate!
