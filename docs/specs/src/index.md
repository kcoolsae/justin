# Bebras International Workshop Information System

(aka *Justin*)

This web page contains the *preliminary* software requirement specifications for that project, 
and some additional (technical) information.

A demo version of the application is already available at
[https://justin.ugent.be/justin](https://justin.ugent.be/justin). Please contact the author
if you want a registration invite.

See
* [Overview](overview.md)
* [Form mockups](mockups/formpage1.html) - what the forms could look like. The application demo already
   contains some forms, which may differ slightly in appearance from the mockups. 
* [Events / categories](events.md)
* [Form structure](forms.md)

Recent changes
* September 2025. Revived the demo. (The system was not used in 2025.)
* December 16, 2024 - [registration](overview.md#registration) procedure. Rewrite of other pages to
  better conform to the actual application as it is being implemented.
* December 9, 2024 - [mockups](mockups/pending.html) of the landing page, depending on status.
* [Less recent changes](changes.md)

Schedule
* High priority: the interface for the user: authentication, registration, data entry
* Medium priority: data retrieval by authorised users
* Lower priority: compilation of question forms (could be done offline for the first year), assignment of roles, special cases
