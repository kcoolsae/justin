For comparison: this is what Google Forms allows:

The form itself can have a title and description. A theme can be chosen (colours and fonts)
and header image. (These are repeated on all pages of the form.)

A form can be divided into subsections (pages). The first subsection

Questions can be of different type
* Multiple choice (with or without 'other')
* Multiple response (with or without 'other')
* Multiple choice (drop down menu)
* Short answer (text field)
* Long answer (paragraph)
* Date
* Others (not relevant?) File upload/linear scale/rating/checkbox grid/multiple choice grid/time

Title blocks can be used before/in between/after questions.

Questions can have additional descriptions.

Images can also be used as options for e.g., multiple choice questions
and as part of questions and descriptions.

Google allows for conditional questions: answer to a multiple choice or dropdown
question can determine the next section to move to.
